Ques 7. Researchers designed one system that classified interactive and noninteractive processes automatically by looking at the amount of terminal I/O. If a process did not input oroutput to the terminal in a 1-second interval, the process was classified as noninteractiveand was moved to a lower-priority queue. In response to this policy, one programmermodified his programs to write an arbitrary character to the terminal at regular intervalsof less than 1 second. The system gave his programs a high priority, even though theterminal output was completely meaningless.
Ques 20.There are 3 student processes and 1 teacher process. Students are supposed to do theirassignments and they need 3 things for that pen, paper and question paper. The teacherhas an infinite supply of all the three things. One students has pen,an other has paper andanother has question paper. The teacher places two things on a shared table and thestudent having the third complementary thing makes the assignment and tells the teacheron completion. The teacher then places another two things out of the three and again thestudent having the third thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion.This cycle continues. WAP to synchronize the teacher and the students.
